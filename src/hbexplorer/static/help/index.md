HBase Explorer
==============

Welcome to the [Hue](http://github.com/cloudera/hue) based [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/) Explorer. 

The HBase Explorer app for Hue provides you with means to browse HBase clusters. On the intial screen you are able to
define as many remote cluster as you like. From that list you can then subsequently explore the clusters.

Each cluster is opened in its on window initially showing information about the cluster and the available tables.

The source for this app is on [GitHub](http://github.com/larsgeorge/hbase-explorer). Have fun!
